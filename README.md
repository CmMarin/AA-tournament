## Overview
**r/AmITheTat** is a cheeky and effective Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma strategy that blends classic Tit-for-Tat behavior with a clever exploitative twist. It opens with cooperation, mimics the opponentâ€™s moves, and then defects on the final round to secure a win. This strategy capitalizes on predictability, ensuring it performs well against both cooperative and defection-prone strategies.

## Features
- **Initial Cooperation:** Opens with cooperation to build trust.
- **Tit-for-Tat Behavior:** Mirrors the opponent's previous move, promoting mutual cooperation unless the opponent defects.
- **Final Round Defection:** Always defects in the final round to maximize points.
- **No Complex Pattern Recognition:** This strategy is simple yet highly effective, relying on basic game theory principles.

## Strategy Flow

1. **Start with Cooperation:** The first move is always a cooperative move to foster trust.
2. **Mimic the Opponent's Moves:** In all subsequent rounds, the strategy simply mirrors the opponent's last move, as in Tit-for-Tat.
3. **Defect in the Final Round:** Regardless of the opponent's behavior, this strategy defects in the final round to secure a better outcome.

## Strategy Behavior

### Early Rounds:
- **Round 1:** Cooperates to build trust and establish a friendly start.
- **Rounds 2 and onwards:** Continues to mimic the opponent's previous move, adopting the Tit-for-Tat strategy to maintain cooperation.

### Endgame:
- **Final Round:** Defects to ensure maximum points and take advantage of the last-move advantage.
